### Hey! 👋

Full stack developer passionate about creating scalable and efficient systems. I have 4+ years of experience in developing web, desktop, and serverside applications, and recently started exploring game development. I primarily work in Typescript, but am comfortable with Python, C++, C#, and Java.

Recently I've been working on a project called Vision, an NFT Platform for traders. Check it out [here](https://www.visiontools.io/)
